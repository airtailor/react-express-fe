By opting out, you may still receive ads from Air Tailor, but you\n        still stop receiving ads from Air Tailor that have been targeted to you\n        based on your visits and browsing activity across websites over time.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        2. Do Not Track Signals\n        <br />\n        At this time we honor web browser Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals and Do\n        Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT)\n        browser mechanism is in place.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        V. MARKETING AND EMAIL COMMUNICATION\n        <br />\n        By providing your email address to us, you expressly consent to receive\n        emails from us, where permitted by law. We may use email to communicate\n        with you, to send information that you have requested or to send\n        information about other products or services developed or provided by us\n        or our partners. If you do not want to receive commercial email or other\n        mail from us, you may unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link at the\n        bottom of an email you receive. Please note that if you do not want to\n        receive legal notices from us, such as notices regarding this Privacy\n        Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services,\n        and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes. We\n        may receive a confirmation when you open an email from Air Tailor if\n        your computer supports this type of program. Air Tailor uses this\n        confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and to\n        improve our service.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        VI. SECURITY\n        <br />\n        Air Tailor uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and\n        procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information against loss\n        or unauthorized access, use, modification, or deletion. However, no\n        security program is foolproof, and thus we cannot guarantee the absolute\n        security of your Personal Information or Other Information. We will\n        retain your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary to\n        accomplish the purposes in this Privacy Policy or as required by law.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        VII. FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES\n        <br />\n        Should a data breach occur, we will notify you via email within 7\n        business days.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that\n        individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against\n        data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This\n        principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights\n        against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or\n        government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by\n        data processors.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        VIII. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY\n        <br />\n        We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information\n        we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time\n        such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal\n        Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our\n        Website or sending you a message. You are bound by any changes to the\n        Privacy Policy when you use the Services after such changes have been\n        first posted.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        IX.
